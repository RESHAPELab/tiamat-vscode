# Tiamat VS Code
**Version: 0.2.0**

Tiamat is a LLM-based conversational agent for VS Code intended for use by novice programming students. To best serve this population, it implements guards to coach, model, and scaffold computational thinking skills.

## Features

### Copilot Chat Participant
This extension contributes a chat participant for Copilot, which implements the intended behavior through a third-party backend. Simply mention `@tiamat` before your chat message to activate it.

### File Context
Tiamat can currently accept context from your files in two different ways:
1. You can provide the content of the file you are currently working on, as indicated by the "Current file" label in the Copilot window. You can also focus on a specific part of your code by simply highlighting it.
2. You can explicitly reference other files in your message by typing `#` and then the file name. When you do this, an autocomplete should appear to help you select files.

## Requirements

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Node.js with npm/npx](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

## For Users

If you are here because you want to use this extension, here's how you install it.

### Obtain a .vsix file

In order to manually install the extension to VS Code, you will need a .vsix file. These can be found in the `/builds` directory of this repository. Download the file corresponding to the version you want, ideally the latest version. It will be named something like `tiamat-x.x.x.vsix`.

### Install the .vsix file

Once you have the file, follow these steps to install it:
1. Open VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `F1`)
3. Search for and select: Extensions: Install from VSIX...
4. Select the .vsix file you downloaded.
5. If prompted, restart VS Code.

### Confirm Installation

If the extension is installed successfully, a "Tiamat Personalization" option should appear in the status bar. Additionally, you can simply try prompting the chatbot to ensure it is working properly.

## For Developers

Before you get started, make sure you have Node.js, npm/npx, and VS Code installed.

Once you've cloned the repository to your local machine, navigate to the directory and run `npm install` to set up your environment with all of the required packages.
